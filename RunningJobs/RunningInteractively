There are two options for running the muon collider software interactively.

The furst option is to use the machine mucol01:

Log into mucol01. If you can't log in, email help@hep.wisc.edu and ask for access to mucol01.

ssh mucol01
mkdir /scratch/`whoami`
cd /scratch/`whoami`

Then follow the instructions here starting with "Test":

https://confluence.infn.it/display/muoncollider/Installation#Installation-Simulation

Note the last step takes a long time for the full display to show.


===================================================================
The second option is to use a login node:

Start with the scripts "mucoljobinter.sh" and "ilcsoft.sh", found in this directory. You may need to revise them for your task. 

Log into one the of login nodes: ssh login.hep.wisc.edu
Set up your files in /nfs_scratch in a directory under your user name. For example, my user name is "cvuosalo",
so I created my own directory under /nfs_scratch with "mkdir /nfs_scratch/cvuosalo".

Create a job submission directory (any name you choose) and put the scripts "mucoljobinter.sh" and "ilcsoft.sh" in it. Make sure
both scripts are executable:

chmod a+x mucoljobinter.sh ilcsoft.sh
ls -l mucoljobinter.sh ilcsoft.sh

Example output from ls -l:

-rwxrwxr-x 1 cvuosalo cvuosalo 375 Apr  1 11:22 ilcsoft.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 cvuosalo cvuosalo 133 Mar 17 21:48 mucoljobinter.sh

Note that executable files have x's in their permissions (-rwxrwxr-x). Files that run programs must be executable.

Then run the mucoljobinter.sh script:
./mucoljobinter.sh

It will run for a while and leave a directory that starts with "jobHome". This directory will have the output of the job.
