Please read RunningJobsOnCluster for general instructions about running jobs on the cluster.

If your program specifically needs the EL7 operating system and doesn't run successfully on EL8 nodes,
use the container.sh script. With the container, your program will be run under EL7 on any node, regardless
of the operating system version that the node has.

Here's an example of how to call RunWiscJobs.py with container.sh to call a program called myscript.sh:

python /usr/local/bin/runWiscJobs.py \
  --WorkFlow trymucol1 \
  --Executable=container.sh \
  --Arguments=myscript.sh \
  --nJobs=2 \
  --TransferInputFiles=myscript.sh \
  --HDFSProdDir None \
  --Experiment mucol \
  --MemoryRequirements 2048

Note that your script must be listed both for Argument and for TransferInputFiles.
